## <a name="intro" id="intro"></a>Overview

This mod adds Isra Ghadir, a young paladin of Sune Firehair, to Baldur's Gate (TuTu, BGT, or BGEE). A follower of the goddess of love, beauty, and passion, Isra isn't necessarily what you might expect of a paladin. As a result, she's usually pretty willing to ignore harmlessly chaotic behavior (not evil behavior, though). She is amiable, optimistic, and courteous almost to a fault. She is also still somewhat inexperienced, and not too proud or rigid to admit when she's wrong.

You can find her in the Nashkel Mines region, trying (with no success whatsoever) to resolve Prism's legal difficulties.

&nbsp;

**Content:**
- A new cavalier paladin NPC for BG.
- Voicing.
- An extensive friendship path with a protagonist.
- Banters with the original Bioware NPCs.
- Interjections and commentary.
- Opportunities for flirtation that may eventually develop into a romance.
- Player initiated dialogue.

## <a name="compat" id="compat"></a>Compatibility

#### Games supported

This mod is designed to work on the following Infinity Engine games: Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition (BG2:EE), the conversion projects <a href="https://www.pocketplane.net/bg1tutu/">Baldur's Gate Tutu</a>, <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/forum/261-bgt-weidu/">Baldur's Gate Trilogy (BGT)</a> and <a href="https://github.com/K4thos/EET/releases">Enhanced Edition Trilogy (EET)</a>.

The Tales of the Sword Coast (TotSC) expansion is not required to play the Isra NPC mod.

## 

#### Other Mods Compatibility

This is a WeiDU mod, and therefore should be compatible with all WeiDU mods for BG TuTu, BG:EE or BGT, including BG1NPC. However, we cannot test every single one. If you encounter any bugs, please <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/forum/638-isra/">report them on the forum</a>!

## 

#### Installation Order

>Although it is not required for Isra NPC to function properly, classical game players are strongly recommended to download and install the latest version of the <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/bg2fixpack/">BG2 Fixpack</a> before proceeding with the installation of this mod.<br>

Here is the recommended installation order:
- Please install Isra NPC after TobEx, BG2 Fixpack, EET, Gavin and Valerie.
- Please install Isra NPC before EET_End, and any final "biffing" routines.

## <a name="installation" id="installation"></a>Installation

#### Notes

*If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting the new version. To do this, run __`setup-isra.exe`__, un-install all previously installed components and delete the :file_folder: __isra__ folder.*

*When installing or un-installing, __do not close the DOS window__ by clicking on the __X__ button! Instead, press the __Enter__ key whenever instructed to do so.*

*__Disable any antivirus__ or other memory-resident software before installing this or any other mod. Some (particularly avast and Norton!) have a tendency to report false positives with mod activity, resulting in failed installs.*

## 

#### Special Note for Siege of Dragonspear from Steam/GOG

Good Old Games (GOG) and Steam both package the additional content for Siege of Dragonspear in a method that WeiDU, the tool used to install this mod, cannot access. You must run a program called <a href="https://github.com/Argent77/A7-DlcMerger/releases/latest">DLC Merger</a> on your SoD installation before you can install this or any other WeiDU-based mod.

## 

#### Enhanced Editions Note

The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages.

## 

#### Windows

Isra NPC for BGII for Windows is distributed as an extractable compressed archive and includes a WeiDU installer.

Extract the contents of the mod archive into the folder of the game you wish to modify (*the folder which contains the "CHITIN.KEY" file*), using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a>, <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>, or another file compression utility that handles .zip files. On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: isra folder and a setup-isra.exe file in your game folder. To install, simply double-click **`setup-isra.exe`** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **`setup-isra.exe`** in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change the components settings.

## 

#### Mac OS

Isra NPC for BGII for Mac OS is distributed in the same compressed archive and includes a WeiDU installer.

First, extract the files from the archive into your game directory. On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: isra folder, setup-isra and setup-isra.command files in your game folder. To install, simply double-click **`setup-isra.command`** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **`setup-isra.command`** in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change the components settings.

## 

#### Linux

Isra NPC for BGII for Linux is distributed in the same compressed archive and does not include a WeiDU installer.

Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify.

Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="https://github.com/WeiDUorg/weidu/releases">WeiDU.org</a> and copy weidu and weinstall to `/usr/bin`. Following that, open a terminal, **`cd`** to your game installation directory, run tolower and answer 'Y' to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only this mod since the last time you lowercased file names. If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.

To install, run **`weinstall setup-isra`** in your game folder. Then run **`wine bgmain.exe`** (or **`wine baldur.exe`** for EE games), and start playing.

## 

#### Note for Complete Un-installation

In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely un-install the mod using **`setup-isra --uninstall`** at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts.</br>

## <a name="details" id="details"></a>Details

<img style="float: left;" src="isra/readme/images/rhisral.png"> Isra is a twenty year old squire-paladin with the Sisters and Brothers of the Ruby Rose, the Sunite paladinic order. She is a follower of Sune Firehair, the goddess of love, beauty, and passion, and the only chaotic aligned deity to sponsor paladins. As such, she has far more experience with (and sympathy for) the chaotic good churches of Sune and Lliira than any of the lawful churches, and associates with some of the most mirthful churches in the Realms.

So her outlook and personality are somewhat removed from what you might expect from a paladin. Don't expect sermons or proselytism: the Firehair's faith is something better served by building close friendships than by lecturing dogma, and Isra understands that. She definitely still believes in honor, discipline, and order, but she tends to value the courtly aspects of the code of conduct more highly than the demands of duty. As a result, she's usually pretty willing to ignore harmlessly chaotic behavior (not evil behavior, though).

Isra is Amnish, most recently from Crimmor, the Caravan Capital of Amn, and she can be found near Nashkel, trying (with no success whatsoever) to resolve Prism's legal difficulties. Aid her in protecting him from Greywolf, and she will offer to help you investigate the nearby mines and clear them. Make sure you recruit her before clearing them, however. They pose enough of a threat that she'll be willing to take action first and seek permission later; otherwise she'd feel obligated to return south to her order instead of gallivanting off with strangers.

Troubled by the hints of conspiracy and the threat of war, Isra will be very eager to follow your quest to its ultimate conclusion. She won't join the company of an evil PC under any circumstances. She won't be rude about it, but she does have the magic to tell. She also won't stick around if your reputation drops below 6.

## 

#### Statistics

- Strength 16
- Dexterity 12
- Constitution 16
- Intelligence 13
- Wisdom 14
- Charisma 17

## 

#### Biography

> When asked about her past, Isra laughs and admits that there is precious little to tell thus far. She explains that she has spent the past eight years in Crimmor, the Caravan Capital of Amn, living amongst her mother's kin while squired to a paladin of Sune in the Order of the Ruby Rose. As much as she seems to enjoy speaking about the city, you are left with the impression that she is quite thrilled to finally be away from it and out in the world on her own.

## 

#### Notes

- **You will need to recruit her before clearing the mines.** Isra is a squire-paladin with other obligations and responsibilities, and will not feel comfortable gallivanting off with strangers without good cause.
- **Isra will not join the party if the protagonist is of evil alignment.** She won't be rude about it, but she is a paladin. She can tell.
- If you don't accept her into your party when she first offers, she's gone for good. If you drop her later, you can find her in the Nashkel inn.
- Isra's friendship track includes thirteen talks, beginning after the Nashkel mines are cleared. Two are triggered upon resting in an inn, and the latter half of the track is largely chapter dependent.
- Your reputation has to be 10 or higher to advance the friendship track.
- Don't let your reputation drop below 6 if you want to keep her around.
- While disrespectful comments won't alienate her completely, Isra values courtesy very highly and won't be very happy with you if you're rude to her.
- Isra is intended to be a romance option in BGII for a good-aligned protagonist of any race or gender with a charisma of 13 or greater. You may flirt with her in BGI, though she won't be interested in anything more serious until BGII.
- Isra doesn't get into lethal arguments with any other joinable NPC, though her relationships with evil NPCs are strained at best, downright hostile at worst.

## 

#### NPC Relationships

If you want to choose NPCs by how much they talk, Quayle, Tiax, Faldorn, and Shar-Teel only have one banter a piece. Dorn sort of has one, though it's not exactly a banter. Branwen, Coran, Dynaheir, Imoen, Khalid, and Jaheira all have three (as does Eldoth if Skie is around). Everyone else has two.

She tends to get along with most of the good and neutral aligned folk, though there's a bit of religious tension with Ajantis at times, and Branwen as well (Sune hates Tempus; Tempus doesn't care). Rasaad is probably somewhat interesting from a religious perspective also. She gets along really well with Khalid, though there's some tension with Jaheira. She may be crushing on Dynaheir a little bit, though it's a bit hard to tell. Her relationship with Coran is more than a bit mercurial. She does not like Safana at all, while Safana mostly just finds her amusing.
